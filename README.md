# Face-Recognition

## Introduction
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

Have you noticed that Facebook has developed an uncanny ability to recognize your friends in your photographs? In the old days, Facebook used to make you tag your friends in photos by clicking on them and typing in their name. Now as soon as you upload a photo, Facebook tags everyone for you. This technology is called Face Recognition.
We also open a webcam to take our own picture and get recognized by our name or other people who are in the known directory.

## Prerequisites

This post assumes familiarity with deep learning concepts and Computer Vision. Here we will be using OpenCV library for computer vision tasks and face_recognition library for specifically detecting similar faces. You can find the official GitHub link of the face_recognition library [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). For installing <b>face_recognition</b> we need to have <b>dlib</b> and <b>cmake</b>.
